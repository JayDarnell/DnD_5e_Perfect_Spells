# Dungeons and Dragons 5e Spell A Day

### Goals 

* Input one spell a day (or more) into a json format
* Make a _perfect_ spell list. Have yet to find one online.
* For my own parsing use and speeding up gameplay in my own games
* A motive to get used to the json format
    * [Java Script Object Notation](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp)
* and build a fast accurate parser that works for me

### How to Use?

* You don't. It's not done.
* The main data file for this project is [spells/dnd_5e_spells.json](spells/dnd_5e_spells.json)

### Halp

* feel free to fix typos and errors and open a pull request to make changes, while I try to make these prefect, there are bound to be mistakes.
* add spells in the exact format as the others
    * go off the [Player's Handbook](http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook) lists on pages 207-211 for which classes can use the spell. 
    * there can always be 'special cases' for other classes using whatever spell. Doesn't make the fireball spell a fighter spell.

### Support

* for my time
* see the donations links on my other repos for now I guess :? [DMPOWER](https://github.com/bytePro17124/DMPOWER)


### License

### ToDo

1. build parser (this will be ultra handy) : In Progress
   * typable or combobox search fields that slim down the selection as you type
        * fields: Name, Classes, Level, School, Casting Time, Duration, Ritual, Components, Material
   * interface options to consider
        * qt
        * webpage
        * visual studio
        * other options
2. finish json spell list
