### Help

* Feel free to fix typos and errors and open a pull request to make changes, while I try to make these prefect, there are bound to be mistakes.
    * Add spells in the exact format as the others.
    * Go off the [Player's Handbook](http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook) lists on pages 207-211 for which classes can use the spell.
