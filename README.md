# D&D 5e Perfect Spells

## Goal 

* Input all D&D Fifth Edition Spells into JSON format.
    * [Java Script Object Notation](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp)
    * Aim for Quality

## JSON Spell Data File

* [dnd_5e_spells.json](spellData/dnd_5e_spells.json)
* Grab the data via git clone
    * `git clone git@github.com:bytePro17124/DnD_5e_Perfect_Spells.git`
    * Everything else is just whatever, I was messing around with options for displaying the list


### Halp

* Feel free enter in more spells and fix typos and errors. While I try to make these prefect, there are bound to be mistakes.
    * Add spells in the exact format as the others.
        * Go off the [Player's Handbook](http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook) lists on pages 207-211 for which classes can use the spell. 

### License

* These spells are from the Wizards of the Coast books unless otherwise mentioned on the spell, and thus owned by them as far as I know.

   * typable or combobox search fields that slim down the selection as you type
