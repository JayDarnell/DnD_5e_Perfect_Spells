# D&D 5e Perfect Spells

### Goals 

* Input all D&D Fifth Edition Spells into JSON format
    * Aim for perfection.
    * For my own personal use.
    * [Java Script Object Notation](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp)

### How to Use?

* It's not done yet.
    * The web parser will be hosted [here](https://bytePro17124.github.io/DnD_5e_Perfect_Spells)
* The main data file for this project is 
    * [spells/dnd_5e_spells.json](spells/dnd_5e_spells.json)

### Help

* Feel free to fix typos and errors and open a pull request to make changes, while I try to make these prefect, there are bound to be mistakes.
    * Add spells in the exact format as the others.
    * Go off the [Player's Handbook](http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook) lists on pages 207-211 for which classes can use the spell.
